# Smart-Parking-System
Smart parking system makes parking easier and efficient. When car enters parking lot CCTV scans for number plate of car and when number plate is detected it extracts information from image of number plate. Then driver has to scan his driving license where this system finds for a photo of holder and scans it and save it. All other information of driverâ€™s license is also extracted and stored. At time of exit face of person driving car is captured and matched with the corresponding face of data and if it matches then he/she is allowed to exit parking area. Also CCTV scans for empty parking space in parking area.
